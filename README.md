# BettingWithDice
My first project over 100 lines

# How the game works
First: You can either set the custom cash amount for each player, or leave it default at $1500<br/>
Second: Select how many dice you want to roll(5,10,15,20).<br/>
Third: Ask each player how much they want to bet.<br/>
Lastly it will print the results, the new balance amounts, and ask if you want to play again.<br/>
